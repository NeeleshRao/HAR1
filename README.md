Human Activity Recognition using Image Processing

The first link is where I created a small Gym Tracker application for Human Activity Recognition.
It uses the mediapipe framework for Computer Vision. The source code cn be found in the jupyter notebook.

This is the link for viewing the output of pose estimation using YOLO-v7. YOLO(You only Look once) is a single shot full neural network for image processing.
Here, I used YOLO for pose estimation of football players.

The source code of this was unfortunately too large to upload to github.
